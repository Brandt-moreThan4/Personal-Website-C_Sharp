# Personal Webiste C# version

This was my first attempt at creating a personal website which I made while I was learning C#. But then I quite working at Strategic which is where I was using C# and 
decided to switch everything over to python using the Django web framework instead. Best decision I ever made. I'm also pretty sure that this website is still live, but I forgot
what the url is.
